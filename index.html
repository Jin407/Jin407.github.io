      <h3>Computer Science Student</h3>

      <p>Hi, I am currently studying at SIM(GE), University of Wollongong with a major on big data</p>
      <div></div>
      <p>Previously, I studied Banking and Finance in Ngee Ann Polytechnic for my diploma. However, 
         for my bachelor's I have decided to explore a different field of study that will give me a
         more diverse skillset. </p>
      <div></div>
      <p>My exposure to both knowledge fields in finance and computer science has certainly broaden my horizens.
         Given the opportunity, I wish to work on implementing big data analytics in the financial sector to optimize
         financial processes.
      </p>
